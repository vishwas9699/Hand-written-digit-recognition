### The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

### Samples provided from MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset includes handwritten digits total of 70,000 images consisting of 60,000 examples in training set and 10,000 examples in testing set, both with labeled images from 10 digits (0 to 9).Handwritten digits are images in the form of 28*28 gray scale intensities of images representing an image along with the first column to be a label (0 to 9) for every image.
